How to use technology to handle other technology, so you can focus on working on physics.

I'm a physics graduate student who spends way too much time trying to think about workflows and automation,
so I intend this blog to mostly focus on that. There's a lot of opportunity to use automation to improve both the
quality of science and the quality of life of scientists. Because more and more tasks are being handled by computers,
I think it's worth treating physics software as an integral part of the physics process, as opposed to just looking
at it as something to hack together haphazardly just to get at results. I talked a bit
[in this post introducing this blog]({% post_url 2018-10-04-introducing-this-blog %}) about what kinds of things
I think physicists should be doing.

problems, that's the best place to report it.

## About the site

This site is hosted with GitHub pages, using Jekyll, which is an awesome way to manage a blog using just simple
plaintext files and no cumbersome CMS. The CSS mostly uses (Poole)[https://github.com/poole/poole], and the
(Lanyon theme)[http://lanyon.getpoole.com]. For other specific features I've tried to credit the parts I've stolen in
their relevant files.

I use Google Analytics because I love data. However, I anonymise IPs, and I believe no personal data is tracked.
Additionally, if you have Do Not Track enabled, the analytics script will not be downloaded.
