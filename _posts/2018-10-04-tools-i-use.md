Here's a list of the software tools I use most frequently for physics
projects.

I don't intend on writing tutorials for each of these tools individually. Most of these tools are very popular, and
have spectacular tutorials already written for them.

## Git
[Git](https://git-scm.com/), or less ideally another version control system, is the single most useful tool I've ever
used, in any context. I assumed it was widely used, but asking around, it seems like it isn't. I often say that things
that happen outside version control don't count. Spending a half hour learning how to use Git will save you tons of
time in the future.

Version control essentially keeps track of different versions of files as you edit them. This lets you revert changes
to a file if you ever make a mistake, it lets you use multiple versions of a directory (so you can try testing out some
changes to some files, while leaving the original versions available if you ever need to switch back and forth). VCSs
also let you intelligently merge changes, whether because you and a collaborator are working on the same file or because
you happen to have two sets of changes you want to work on at the same time.

If you want to make collaboration a breeze, you can either connect to something like [GitHub](https://github.com/)
or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), hosting services which let you upload your code, along with all of its version
history. You can make repositories private or pubic, or even set up your ownserver if you want to collaborate but don't
want your code to leave your control. Hosting services like that are separate from using Git, and aren't required to get
the version management, but are another great part of your workflow. [Here's this blog in GitHub!]({{site.github.repo}})

This is separate from tools like Dropbox or its competitors. Those types of services are mostly intended as ways to
backup a file system. If you want to create copies of your entire `Documents` folder, put it on Dropbox. Git is much
more about keeping track of the history of a single project, and simplifying your workflow.

The pros:
* Git allows you to handle file history intelligently, no matter what you're doing on your computer. If your computer
use involves modifying files, Git will let you track it, share it with other computers and live a more fulfilled life.
* Git is an incredibly popular tool, which means that it's been optimised on every platform, and has a huge ecosystem
built around it. Don't like the command line? There are a thousand tools that let you use Git with a GUI. Have too many
options? Try using more restrictive workflows.

The cons:
